# API Endpoints

- Add a router and controller for the new model
    - Make sure to hook it up in `index.js`
    - The router & controller files have not been provided for you this time. If you need a reference, it's a good idea to look at previous exercises to figure out how to implement this
    - All of the routes you're about to build can be contained in this single router and controller, we don't need to rebuild the work you've already done

- Add a route to get a list of records for the new model for a particular screen, using a `screenId` parameter
- Add a route to create a new ticket with relations to the new model
