# Update the Schema

1. Add the new model and its relationships to the `prisma/schema.prisma` file.
2. Run `npx prisma generate` to recompile the prisma client.
3. Run `npx prisma migrate dev --create-only --skip-seed --name new_model` to create a migration.
4. Update the `prisma/seed.js` file to create records for the new model and satisfy its relationships.
5. Run `npx prisma migrate reset` to apply the migration and run the seed file.
