# Auth Client

## Learning Objectives

- Use an authentication API to implement a front-end user login form.

## Pre-requisites

- You must have completed the [auth-hashing](https://github.com/boolean-uk/auth-hashing) exercise.

## Introduction

This exercise asks you to complete a user registration and login form that interacts with the auth-hashing API you completed previously. There are two paths through this exercise:

1. Use pre-built forms where you focus on implementing the register / login functions
2. Build the forms yourself
