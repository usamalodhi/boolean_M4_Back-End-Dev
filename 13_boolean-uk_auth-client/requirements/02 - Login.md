# Login a user

Work inside the `login` function in `src/App.jsx`.

1. Send a request to your [auth-hashing](https://github.com/boolean-uk/auth-hashing) API with the user's credentials in the body.
2. Save the response in state using the `setLoginResponse` function.
3. You will see a JWT displayed under the login form if you were successful.
