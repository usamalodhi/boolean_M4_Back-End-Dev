# Register a user - API

A `POST` API route has already been set up for `http://localhost:4000/user/register`. You can see it in [src/server/routers/user.js](../src/server/routers/user.js).

Do the work for this requirement in the `register` function in [src/server/controllers/user.js](../src/server/controllers/user.js).

1. Using the `username` and `password` provided in the request body, create a new user. The password *must* be hashed before creation.
