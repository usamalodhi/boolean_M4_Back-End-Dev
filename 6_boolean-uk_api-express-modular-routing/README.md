# Express Modular Routing

In this exercise, you are going to extend the REST APIs you have been building to handle DELETE and PUT requests. You will also learn how to make your route handling more modular in express using express.Router.

## Learning Objectives

- Use Express.Router to encapsulate routing behavior for different resources
- Explain and build a CRUD RESTful JSON API including PUT and DELETE

## Setup

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone the forked repository onto your local machines
3. In the root directory, type `npm install`, which installs dependencies for the project
4. Finally, type `npm start`, which starts a development server that will reload whenever you make any changes to source files

## Demo

Your instructor will demonstrate how to encapsulate route parameters for the `/users` endpoints using [express.Router](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) and also implement the `PUT` and `DELETE` endpoints for user.

## Standard Criteria

- Implement the `films` and `books` endpoints for this API according to the [API spec](#api-spec)

## Extended Criteria

- Implement a `PATCH` method on `books` and `films` so that the client can update a subset of fields, rather than all of them.
- Implement the following validation rules:
  - The client should not be able to get, delete, or update a film that doesn't exist
  - The client should not be able to add a film or book if one with the same title already exists
  - When making a POST request, the client must specify a value for all required fields
- When any of these checks fail, have your API return an appropriate HTTP response code and error message.
- Use the express documentation to find out how to return different HTTP response codes.
