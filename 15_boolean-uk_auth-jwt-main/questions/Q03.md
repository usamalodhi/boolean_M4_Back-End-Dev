## Question

What two pieces of information are used to construct the signature for a JWT?

## Answer

### **JWS signature**

The signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way.

To create the signature, the Base64-encoded header and payload are taken, along with a secret, and signed with the algorithm specified in the header.

For example, if you are creating a signature for a token using the HMAC SHA256 algorithm, you would do the following:

```
HMACSHA256(
      base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
      base64UrlEncode(payload),
      secret)
```
