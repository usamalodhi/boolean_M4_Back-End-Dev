The option secret base64 encoded on https://jwt.io means that the secret you paste into the input field is base64 encoded an therefore needs to be decoded before it is applied. Then jwt.io makes this extra step to decode the secret first.

jwt.io indeed produces the same hash in both cases:

secret = 'abc' and secret base64 encoded= no or <br />
secret = 'YWJj' and secret base64 encoded = yes, <br />
so that part works fine and behaves as expected.

But your OpenSSL command lines are exactly the same, only the keys are different. OpenSSL doesn't know about your encoding and treats them just as different keys, therefore producing different results.
